### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ˜º Deivitto
I'm originally a software engineer that always loved traditional security, in my free time I used to be dedicated to fullstack and cross platform applications, with special love to the UX part and team management, 

Now I'm focused on blockchain and it's security auditing for Spearbit, Code4rena, SherlockDeFi and doing some privates audits.
